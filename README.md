Coding Bootcamp Homework Week 1

Updates to the code as follows:
HTML file updated with sematic HTML, in order to simplify the CSS file and make it accessible to screen readers.
Alt text added to all the images in the HTML and CSS files.
CSS file simplified by pulling stylistic elements up to the highest level, e.g. fonts were common to almost every element, so could be mentioned once in <body> rather than every element.  Same applied to background colours and images, which are now common to the <article> and <aside> level.
Finally, I reviewed the files against the criteria outlined here: https://moritzgiessmann.de/accessibility-cheatsheet/
